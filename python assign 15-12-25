PYTHON MATCH CASE 
The match statement is used to perform different actions based on  different conditions
Instead of writting many if and if else statement used..., we can use match statement.
The match statement selects one of many code blocks to be excuted.
match expression:
  case x:
    code block
  case y:
    code block
  case z:
    code block
This is how its works:
The match expression is evaluated onces
The value of expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match ,the  associate block of code is excuted.
day = 4
match day:
  case 1:
    print("Monday")
  case 2:
    print("Tuesday")
  case 3:
    print("Wednesday")
  case 4:
    print("Thursday")
  case 5:
    print("Friday")
  case 6:
    print("Saturday")
  case 7:
    print("Sunday")
